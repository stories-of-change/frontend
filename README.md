# Frontend for Climate Atlas by Stories of Change

This is a refactored version of the [previos repo](https://github.com/stories-of-change/atlas). The refactor was done to better structure the codebase and make it easier to maintain it long term. The following changes were brought:

1. The different component names and how they are structured in the app.
2. Using zustand instead of react context for state management to make codebase cleaner.
3. Using tailwindcss in most places to make development easier.
4. Adding typescript support to almost the entire codebase.
